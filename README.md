# Shipping App (Flutter)

A demo Flutter application showcasing role-based access control with three user roles:

1. **Admin**
2. **Shipper**
3. **Customer**

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed. See the official [Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
2. Clone this repository or copy the project files into a new Flutter project directory.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch dependencies.
4. Launch the application:

```bash
flutter run
```

On the login screen, choose a role to navigate to its respective dashboard. Use the logout button (top-right) to return to the login screen.

This project is intended as a starting pointâ€”you can extend each dashboard with full functionality, integrate real authentication (Firebase Auth, REST API, etc.), and replace placeholder UI with production-ready designs.
